# Greed Game

## About the Game

Greed is a simple strategy game where players take turns eating the numbers. The goal is to be the last player to make a move.

## How to Run

To play the game, use this command in your terminal:

```
make play
```

This will compile and run the game automatically.


# Game Modes

## Computer Mode

* The game plays itself with random but valid moves
* Keeps going until it hits a stalemate

## Human Mode

Play the game yourself! You've got two options:

1. Easy Mode: The game shows you all the valid moves you can make
2. Regular Mode: No hints, you're on your own!

## The Makefile

Our Makefile keeps things tidy:

* It compiles the game
* Runs it for you
* Has a 'clean' command to remove old compiled files
